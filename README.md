# Adolescent Sleep Sufficiency & School Physical Violence: An ANOVA Inference

A rigorous data-driven investigation exploring whether nightly sleep duration serves as a statistically significant predictor for the frequency of physical fighting on school property among US high school students, utilizing the YRBS 2007 dataset ($N = 12,040$).

## 🏛️ STUDY CONTEXT
Adolescent sleep deprivation has emerged as a critical public health crisis, frequently linked to emotional dysregulation, impaired cognitive control, and behavioral volatility. While clinical studies establish a link between sleep deficits and generalized irritability, this project bridges data science and school safety policy by evaluating how macro-level sleep variations systematically impact acute externalized aggression (specifically physical fighting) within the school environment.

## ❓ RESEARCH QUESTION
* **Primary Query:** Does nightly sleep duration significantly affect the frequency of physical fighting on school property among adolescents?
* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** Nightly sleep duration has no effect on school physical fighting frequency; the mean fighting scores across all sleep cohorts are identical ($\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots = \mu_7$).
* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** At least one sleep duration cohort exhibits a statistically distinct mean school physical fighting frequency score.

## 📊 SAMPLE PROFILE (YRBS 2007)
* **Data Source:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 2007 National Standard Dataset.
* **Effective Sample Size ($N$):** **12,040 valid observations** after listwise deletion of missing records across targeted variables.
* **Independent Variable (X) - `Sleep_Group`:** Operationalized into 7 distinct ordinal cohorts:
  1. `4 hours or less` (Severe Deprivation)
  2. `5 hours`
  3. `6 hours`
  4. `7 hours`
  5. `8 hours` (Recommended Baseline)
  6. `9 hours`
  7. `10 hours or more` (Hypersomnia/Extreme Group)
* **Dependent Variable (Y) - `PhysicalFightingAtSchool`:** Continuous frequency score mapping how many times a student engaged in a physical fight on school property over the past 12 months (scaled from 1 to 8 based on standardized YRBS coding).

## ⚡ INFERENCE RESULTS & STATISTICAL METRICS

### 1. Descriptive Summary Table
| Sleep Duration Cohort (X) | Sample Size ($n$) | Mean Fighting Score ($ ar{Y}$) | Standard Deviation ($SD$) | Risk Profile |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **4 hours or less** | 744 | **1.688** | 1.582 | 🚨 **Highest Aggression Peak** |
| **5 hours** | 1,239 | 1.225 | 0.769 | Elevated Risk |
| **6 hours** | 2,714 | 1.193 | 0.634 | Moderate Risk |
| **7 hours** | 3,605 | 1.144 | 0.557 | Stabilized Low |
| **8 hours** | 2,767 | **1.169** | 0.597 | **Healthy Baseline** |
| **9 hours** | 727 | 1.216 | 0.691 | Symmetrical Bounce |
| **10 hours or more** | 244 | 1.570 | 1.393 | Secondary Peak |

### 2. Inferential Model: One-Way ANOVA
To test the macro-variance across cohorts, a One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was executed:
* **$F$-Statistic:** `67.7102`
* **$p$-Value:** `3.37492e-83` (Significance Threshold $ lpha = 0.05$)
* **Statistical Decision:** **REJECT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS ($H_0$)** with absolute statistical certainty. Sleep duration heavily and systematically impacts adolescent school-based physical aggression.

### 3. Post-Hoc Tukey HSD Highlights
The Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test reveals that the severe sleep deprivation group (`4 hours or less`) is **completely decoupled** from all standard sleep categories ($p < 0.05$), validating that acute sleep restriction induces an exponential spike in campus conflict risk.

## 🏫 POLICY IMPLICATIONS & CONCLUSION
The empirical statistical evidence demonstrates a stark, non-linear relationship between sleep restrictions and adolescent campus violence. Severe sleep deficits are tightly coupled with heightened aggression. Campus administrative bodies, mental health counselors, and macroeconomic school policies (e.g., school start time delays) should structurally address adolescent sleep hygiene as a primary, preemptive measure to mitigate campus violence and optimize overall school safety.
